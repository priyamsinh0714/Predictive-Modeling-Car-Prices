# Predictive-Modeling-Car-Prices
A comprehensive project for forecasting car prices using advanced regression techniques. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and forecasts, as part of a Macquarie University competition.
# Car Price Forecasting Competition  

## Overview  
This repository contains the solution to the car price forecasting competition exclusively for Macquarie University students enrolled in BUSA3020 and BUSA8001 (Semester 2, 2024). The objective is to forecast car prices based on features provided in the dataset using advanced regression techniques.

## Objectives  
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.  
2. Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values and outliers.  
3. Engineer meaningful features to improve model performance.  
4. Build, train, and evaluate predictive models to forecast car prices.  
5. Achieve the highest ranking on the competition leaderboard.

## Project Workflow  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Understand the dataset structure and identify patterns in the data.  
- Generate visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.  

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Impute missing values using appropriate strategies (mean, median, or predictive imputation).  
- Handle outliers and transform skewed distributions.  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Create new features (e.g., price-per-mile, car-age).  
- Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.  

### 4. Model Building and Evaluation  
- Train multiple regression models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.  
- Use cross-validation to assess model performance.  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model accuracy.  

### 5. Forecasting and Submissions  
- Generate predictions on the test dataset.  
- Create and submit `submission.csv` files to the competition leaderboard.
